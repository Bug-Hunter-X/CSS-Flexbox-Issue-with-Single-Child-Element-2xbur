The following CSS code snippet causes an unexpected rendering issue in some browsers:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
div > span {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
}
```

This code intends to create two spans that are equally spaced within a flex container. However, some browsers might not render this correctly if there is only one `span` element inside the `div`, resulting in unexpected spacing or alignment.
