# CSS Flexbox Issue with a Single Child Element

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to CSS flexbox and single child elements within a flex container.  The problem arises from inconsistencies in how some browsers handle `justify-content: space-between` when only one child element is present.  The expected behavior is for the single element to center itself, but some renderers might leave unexpected spacing.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code, and `bugSolution.css` offers potential solutions to achieve consistent cross-browser compatibility.  This issue is helpful for understanding the nuances of CSS Flexbox and improving the robustness of your layouts.
